# Sokoban

Sokoban is a Japanese puzzle game, designed in 1981. Its title translates to 'warehouse keeper'. The player controls a character who must push every box onto every storage location. The boxes can be pushed, but not pulled; the challenge is to think several steps ahead, and avoid getting stuck in a state from which it is impossible to progress.

- Animation file needs fixing - box-pushing breaks the Planimation
- More levels of larger sizes
- Test suite needs to be made
- Images need to be made
